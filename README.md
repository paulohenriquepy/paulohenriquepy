### 🌱 About Me  

I am a **biologist** committed to bridging the gap between **academic knowledge** and the **development of solutions** for environmental challenges. I hold a **Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences** and I am currently pursuing a **Professional Master's in Data Science and Business Analytics**.  

📌 **Current Research:**  
📊 I use **web scraping** and **sentiment analysis** to investigate how the press represents the **climate emergency**, focusing primarily on 🇺🇸 **the United States**, 🇨🇳 **China**, and 🇧🇷 **Brazil**.  
📌 I also analyze topics such as **political authoritarianism**, **social dominance orientation**, and the **commercial, technological, and economic rivalry between China and the United States**.
